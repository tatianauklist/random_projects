## Random Projects That Might Actually Be Useful 🛠️

A collection of weird, specific tools that solve problems you didn't know you had (or maybe you did).

## What's Here 📦
Projects built on the principle that the best way to learn is to make things that are slightly ridiculous but surprisingly practical.

Each folder contains something different - automation scripts, text analyzers, data processors, or whatever seemed like a good idea at the time. Some solve real problems. 

Some are just fun to build. Most are somewhere in between.

## Philosophy 💭
These aren't polished products. They're experiments, learning exercises, and "what if" questions turned into code. Some will grow into real tools. Some will stay weird. All of them teach something.

If something here solves a problem for you, great. If it gives you an idea for your own random project, even better. ✨

## Running Anything Here 🚀
Each project has its own folder with setup instructions. Requirements are kept minimal by design - if it needs more than basic Python and a couple packages, something went wrong.

Built while learning. Shared because why not. 🤷
