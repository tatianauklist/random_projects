1. Overview


a. Using Canva. Canva is a visual communications platform that empowers people to design and collaborate on virtually anything, including logos, posters and presentations, videos, documents, whiteboards, websites and other materials (each a “Design”). When you use the Service, you’ll have access to a variety of content provided by Canva and other content providers to use in your designs (“Licensed Content”). Your use of the Licensed Content is subject to the Content License Agreement. You also have the option to upload your own content (“User Content”), such as videos, images, and files, which you have full control and responsibility over. You can use Licensed Content, your User Content, and tools available in Canva to create your Designs.

The Service is made available on Canva websites (such as Canva.com and affinity.studio), Canva mobile apps, Canva desktop applications, and in other forms provided or made available by Canva. Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms and Canva’s Acceptable Use Policy. Canva’s Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service.



If you're using Canva for Education, the Canva for Education Additional Terms also apply.



You may use the Service only if you're legally able to form a binding contract with Canva. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the full right, power and authority to agree to and be bound by these Terms and to fully perform all of your obligations.

b. Signing up with a managed email address. If you sign up for the Service using an email address associated with your employer or another organization (“Admin Entity”), (i) you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Admin Entity to these Terms; (ii) your use of the Service will bind your employer or the organization to these Terms; and (iii) “you” and “your” in these Terms will refer to both you and the Admin Entity. The Canva account you create using an email address associated with an Admin Entity will be an “Administered Account”.

If you’ve signed up for the Service using an Administered Account, at the Admin Entity’s request, Canva may:

share your email address, name and account information with your Admin Entity; and
give control of the Administered Account to the Admin Entity.
If your Administered Account is controlled by an Admin Entity, the Admin Entity’s admin may be able to access, transfer and control your Administered Account and all content and designs associated with it, as well as:

make changes to the Administered Account settings, such as billing settings and privacy preferences;
make changes to the folder permissions; and
delete the Administered Account.
Where an Admin Entity has requested control of an existing Administered Account, Canva will make reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice so that you can transfer your content and designs to a personal Canva account (subject to you providing us with a valid email address) before your Admin Entity receives control over the Administered Account.

Companies or organizations may choose to bring everyone that uses Canva with an email address they manage onto one centrally-managed Canva account.

C. Using Canva with a team. Some of our plans are able to be used by teams, businesses and organizations of all sizes who want to work and design together. If you create a team on behalf of an organization or employer, you're binding them to these Terms and all the obligations set out in them. If they haven’t authorized you to do this, you’ll need someone who is authorized to create the team.

If you are part of a subscription that enables you to create a Team, or you’re a Canva Pro user collecting personal data subject to Applicable Privacy Laws (as defined in the Data Processing Addendum) through a Canva Site or other Design type where the primary functionality of the Design type is to collect information from end users, then Canva collects, uses, transfers, discloses and stores certain personal data on your behalf as a data processor in connection with your use of the Service. In those cases, our Data Processing Addendum applies and is incorporated into these Terms. Our Data Processing Addendum sets out the personal data Canva collects and processing operations Canva performs on your behalf as a data processor. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Data Processing Addendum, the Data Processing Addendum will prevail. Any categories of personal data or processing operations that are not set out in our Data Processing Addendum will be processed and protected by Canva as a data controller subject to and in accordance with Canva’s Privacy Policy.

You can use a url provided by Canva to publish your website. We want others to know they can design websites on Canva, so we let them know that you designed your website on Canva. Since our name will be in the url and on the website, we put a few extra measures in place to make sure websites are appropriate.

b. Purchasing a Domain Name Through Canva. When you purchase, renew or transfer a domain name through Canva, Canva Pty Ltd acts as a reseller for domain name registration services through our third-party registrar, Tucows, Inc. (“Tucows”). If you purchase a domain name through Canva, you agree to and are subject to the Tucows Master Registration Agreement (the “Tucows Terms”). A breach of the Tucows Terms is a breach of these Terms.

Your use of our domain services is subject to the policies of Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (https://icann.org) (“ICANN”). You agree to comply with ICANN’s requirements, standards, policies, procedures and practices. Your rights and responsibilities as a domain name registrant under ICANN’s 2009 Registrar Accreditation Agreement are summarized here. You can learn more about domain name registration in general here.

You agree that by submitting an application or registering or renewing your domain name, you represent and warrant that: (i) all information provided to Canva or Tucows is true, complete and correct and is not misleading in any way and the application is made in good faith; and (ii) you have not previously submitted an application for the domain name and been rejected.

You must provide Canva with such cooperation and support as Canva may reasonably request to provide the Service as it relates to your Canva Site, including by (i) responding promptly to Canva’s communications; (ii) providing accurate and prompt responses to our requests for any information or documentation reasonably required, including to meet ICANN’s verification requirements; (iii) agreeing to your information being shared with ICANN and Tucows; and (iv) obtaining any and all necessary intellectual property rights clearances and/or other consents and authorisations in respect of your proposed domain name.

Registration of a domain name does not create a proprietary right and will not be construed as evidence of ownership. The registration can be subsequently challenged by third parties or canceled if any of the above warranties are found to be untrue, incomplete, incorrect or misleading.

You're responsible for renewing your domain name. Canva will not be liable for a domain name being unavailable or canceled for any reason.

You must not present a misleading endorsement or affiliation with Canva on a Canva Site, including (but not limited to), by attempting to register a domain name or subdomain name that includes the word ‘CANVA’ or any other Canva brand or trademark of Canva or its affiliates. Canva may include or require certain terms to be included on a Canva Site at any time for any reason.

Both the Team Owners and Administrators can (i) add, modify or remove people or seats from the Team as well as manage permissions and access to User Content and Designs. Only the Team Owner may assign a new Team Owner. If you add a person to a seat in a Team, you represent and warrant that you or your organization have obtained all necessary consents from that person to be added. If you enable account management services which allow you to manage the Teams and Users using Canva at your organization, you represent and warrant that you're authorized to do so on behalf of your Team and/or organization.



If you're on a Team, the Team Owner or Administrator may control access to, delete, or re-assign ownership to the User Content you upload and Designs you create on the account you access as part of the Team. Canva is not responsible for any actions taken by Team Owners or Administrators. It is your responsibility to not upload User Content or create Designs on an account associated with a Team if you do not want to potentially transfer ownership or disclose such User Content or Designs to others on the Team.

If you’re on a Team, make sure you’re aware of the privacy settings and only upload content and create designs you’re comfortable with others on the Team having access to and control over. Administrators can transfer designs between people on the Team. Keep your personal content and designs to yourself by creating a personal account.

9. Billing

We'll notify you before auto-renewal of your subscription. You can cancel your subscription at any time, subject to section (d) below.



b. Pricing for Additional Seats on your Team. If you're on a plan that enables you to create a Team, you're billed according to Canva’s “Pay as You Grow” model. When you add seats to a Team, you will be billed for them on your next Billing Date (as defined below) unless they are removed from your Team by the Team Owner or an Administrator prior to the Billing Date. Three (3) days prior to the Billing Date, Canva will notify via email the billing contact associated with your Canva Team account of the number of additional seats and the associated subscription fees. The applicable “Billing Date” is as follows: (i) if you're on a monthly subscription, the date of your next monthly renewal; (ii) if you're on an annual subscription, every 3 months after the start date of your subscription.
